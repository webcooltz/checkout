# Checkout

## Purpose

The purpose of the app is to help small businesses with an easy-to-use and helpful online ordering system. It could be open-source or sold as a SAAS.

The other purpose is to get experience developing full-stack web apps and to showcase that to potential employers.

## Features

Current features
* Add food to cart, checkout
* Edit existing menu, colors, etc.
* View order history

Future features
* Login/auth/permissions
* Bug fixes: Changes being permanent, colors, fonts, etc. auto-updating for UI-friendly design
* Alerts/messages from store to customer
* Queue that shows current orders in order of when they should be ready

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Development

Front end:
* Run `ng serve`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

With back end:
* First build the project.
* Run `npm run start:server`. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Deployment

* Run `firebase deploy` after running the build command. The site will be up shortly at "https://checkout-17e0b.web.app/".
* As far as the back end, I am still figuring out how to deploy that.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
